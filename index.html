				<h3>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h3>

				<h5>a billingual fullstack dev</h5>
				<h6>Fullstack Development</h6>
				<p>
					I love Programming and I have been a Programmer since I was 15 years old, I attended a technical college, where I
					participated in 2 programming Olympics in which I went to the provincial stage (Buenos Aires) and also participated in
					an Arduino Olympiad at the provincial level and received me from Technician in Personal and Professional Informatics,
					Then I attended 2 Internships in the development company Avalith, where I trained in development work, and learned from
					senior developers Reactjs, then I spent 1 year doing various projects and training my frontend skills, this was the year
					where Iâ€™d conceived CaniYA !. After this year I joined Exactian as a fullstack developer, and almost simultaneously I
					was able to work overtime as a frontend at my current Gearthlogic job. During all these years I had the opportunity to
					see, learn and work with many technologies and languages, the latest addition to the list being the Java language. that
					I learned it in my second year of the Systems Engineering career. But of all these technologies the one that I like the
					most and I feel comfortable with is JavaScript. I am someone who does not stop learning, and I am someone who wants to
					spend as much time as possible studying new things or doing interesting projects. If you have a project and you need
					someone to carry it out, I am the right person!
